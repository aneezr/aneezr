### Something about me

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on becoming a full-stack developer.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning nodeJS(ExpressJS).
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open source or freelance projects.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about react or any tech related stuff
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love JS becomes it works just like my GF (that is sometimes I have no idea on what's going on inside).
